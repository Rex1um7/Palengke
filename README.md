# Palengke
An UnCiv mod that adds a unique building to existing Philippine civilations.

### Requirements
The mod, when used by its own, does absolutely nothing. It is 
required that you must have one of these mods for it to work:
- [*Shann's "ph bonifacio unciv" Mod*](https://github.com/shannaurelle/ph-bonifacio-unciv)*ยน*
- [*Angelonius' "Project Felipe" Mod*](https://github.com/Angelonius/Project-Felipe)
- [*Angelonius' "Project Tondo" Mod*](https://github.com/Angelonius/Project-Tondo)
- [*Philippines from Aqua2005's "AquaExtension GAK" Mod*](https://github.com/Aqua2005/AquaExtension-GAK)*ยน*
- [*Sultanate of Sulu from amfauzn's "Borneo Civilization" Mod*](https://github.com/amfauzn/Borneo-Civilization)

###### ยน It is recommended to choose only one or the other as the civilizations technically share the same exact name.
