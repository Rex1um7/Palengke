## Credits
- [**Palengke**](https://thenounproject.com/term/market/1723050/) icon by [sofi](https://thenounproject.com/sofifarwadi) from The Noun Project\*\*
- Mod based on and inspired by a building of the same name from [*CIVITAS Philippines*](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1204698883), a Civilization VI mod

###### \* Each Civ has an individual replacement that is exactly identical to each other.<br>\*\* This is actually the exact same icon UnCiv uses for the Market building. This is a placeholder, I might find a better icon but I'm not sure when or how.
