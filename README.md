# Palengke
An UnCiv mod that adds a unique building to existing modded Philippine civilizations.

### Requirements
The mod, when used by its own, does absolutely nothing. It is required that you must have one of these mods for it to work; 
be careful of what mods to use, however, as some of them could conflict with each other:
- [*"ph bonifacio unciv" by shannaurelle*](https://github.com/shannaurelle/ph-bonifacio-unciv)
	- Civilization: Andres Bonifacio of Philippines
- [*"Project Felipe" by Angelonius*](https://github.com/Angelonius/Project-Felipe)
	- Civilization: Felipe I of Filipinas
- [*"Project Tondo" by Angelonius*](https://github.com/Angelonius/Project-Tondo)
	- Civilization: Bunao Lakandula of Tondo\*
- [*"Nusantara Civilizations" by amfauzn*](https://github.com/amfauzn/Nusantara-Civilizations)ยน
	- Civilizations: Kalangitan of Tondo\*, Humabon of Cebu, Azim Ud-Din I of Sulu, Kudarat of Maguindanao
